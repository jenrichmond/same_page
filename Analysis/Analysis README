This file explains the contents of each file in the 'Analysis' folder.

Study 1A Folder (Analysis > Study 1A)

Study 1A Analysis.Rmd: contains the code that runs Study 1A's ANOVA analyses, generates Figure 2 and 3, and also runs the corresponding *t*-tests. 

Study 1B Folder (Analysis > Study 1B)

Study 1B Confirmatory Analysis (2019-20).Rmd: contains the code that runs the 2019-20 ANOVA analyses (and the corresponding *t*-tests), and generates Figure 4 and 5. 

Study 1B Confirmatory Analysis (2019-20 vs. 2014-15).Rmd: contains the code that runs the 2014-15 vs. 2019-20 ANOVA analyses (and the corresponding *t*-tests), and generates Figure 6 and 7.

Study 1B Exploratory Analysis - Raincloud Plots.Rmd: contains the code that generates the raincloud plots in Figure 8.

Study 1B Exploratory Analysis - Open Science Badges.Rmd: contains the code that generates Figure 9 and 10.

R_rainclouds.R: contains the script needed to produce the function that allows "Study 1B Exploratory Analysis - Raincloud Plots.Rmd" to generate raincloud plots. 

Supplementary Figures Folder (Analysis > Supplementary Figures)

Supplementary Figures (2014-15).Rmd: contains the code that generates two supplementary figures that weren't included in the article. The figures illustrate the percentage of articles, of those that had reported having openly accessible data and materials between 2014-15, that met a series of data and material sharing criteria, respectively.

Supplementary Figures (2019-20).Rmd: contains the code that generates two supplementary figures that weren't included in the article. The figures illustrate the percentage of articles, of those that had reported having openly accessible data and materials between 2019-20, that met a series of data and material sharing criteria, respectively. The criteria are the same as those used in the "Supplementary Figures (2014-15).Rmd" figures.
