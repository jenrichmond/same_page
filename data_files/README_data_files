Master Dataset.csv - Kidwell et al. (2016) master dataset

master_dataset_edited_for_dates.csv - at the start of this project, Christina and Jenny thought that the Article IDs Kidwell et al. had assigned the articles were dates. Some of the dates looked incorrect (e.g. some looked like 38-4-2014), so in this dataset we corrected them. However, Christina later realised that these article IDs weren't dates, they were the number of each article in the issue. So, this dataset is redundant
