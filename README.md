# Are we all on the same page?

Two studies were carried out in this investigation. Study 1A aimed to identify whether data and material sharing differed as a function of psychological subfield. To achieve this aim we used open data from the Kidwell et al. (2016) investigation, which assessed the data and material sharing practices at Psychological Science before and after the journal implemented Open Science Badges. We focussed specifically on the Psychological Science data Kidwell et al. coded after badges had been adopted. After assigning each article to a subfield, we calculated an Open Data and Open Materials Score for each article. These scores indexed the accessibility and usability of each article's data and materials, respectively, where higher scores were indicative of a greater level of accessibility and usability. We analysed Open Data and Open Materials as a function of subfield and time.

In Study 1B, we aimed to determine whether the subfield differences in Open Data and Open Materials Scores, and the changes we had observed over time, in Study 1A, had been sustained in a more recent set of Psychological Science articles.
