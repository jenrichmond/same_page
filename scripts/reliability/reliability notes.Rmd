```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


Example from psych docs

```{r}
library(psych)
```


https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/psych/psych.pdf


```{r}
#rating data (with thanks to Tim Bates)
rater1 = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) # rater one's ratings

rater2 = c(1,3,1,6,1,5,5,6,7) # rater one's ratings

# join raters data together
x <- cbind(rater1,rater2)

# make it a data frame
x <- as.data.frame(x)

# calc kappa
cohen.kappa(x)

```

What if there were more than 2 raters??

```{r}
rater1 = c(1,2,3,4,1,6,4,8,9) # rater 1 ratings

rater2 = c(1,3,1,6,1,5,5,7,7) # rater 2 ratings

rater3 = c(2,3,2,5,1,5,5,8,9) # rater 3 ratings

rater4 = c(1,2,3,4,2,7,5,9,7) # rater 4 ratings

rater5 = c(2,3,2,5,1,5,6,8,7) # rater 5ratings
```

```{r}
# join raters data together
y <- cbind(rater1, rater2, rater3, rater4, rater5)

# make it a data frame
y <- as.data.frame(y)

# calc kappa

cohen.kappa(y)
```


Hmmm not sure whether that warning is important... lets do what it says...

```{r}
describe(y)
```
